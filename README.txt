## THIS IS A BASIC PROJECT

### This is a basic project to test Jenkins

1. The file *basic-script.sh* will be used to test parameters provided by the user to a freestyle project
2. The _*index.html*_ and _*Dockerfile*_ files, are going to be used to test upstream projects and pipelines jobs. 
3. The last laboratory, allows the attendants of the learning lab to create their own Jenkinsfile and test multibranch projects
